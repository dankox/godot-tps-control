My try on implementing basic 3D game.

## Setup
Run `setup.sh` to build the native library and create symbolic link in `godot/` directory which is used by Godot.

Start Godot and import the project from `godot/project.godot` file.

***NOTE:** This implementation was build on OSX system, so the other platforms are not tested. If there is some problem with the setup script or gdnlib, update according to your platform.*
